#create a list called prices

#Find the length of the toppings list and store it in a variable called num_pizzas.

#Store the first element of pizza_and_prices in a variable called cheapest_pizza.
cheapest_pizza = pizza_and_prices[0]

#Get the last item of the pizza_and_prices list and store it in a variable called priciest_pizza

#Since there is no longer an "anchovies" pizza, you want to add a new topping called "peppers" to keep your customers excited about new toppings. 
#Note: Make sure to position it relative to the rest of the sorted data in pizza_and_prices, otherwise our data will not be correctly sorted anymore!
